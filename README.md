# GoodPlays (CMSC 388J Final Project)

GoodPlays is a project created for the CMSC 388J STIC at the University of Maryland by Cameron Bernhardt, Asmit Biswas, and Shruti Ray.

The goal of our project is to create a "Goodreads for games," a website to aggregate reviews of games that users have played. We have done this using IGDB as a data source. You can search for games, read information about them, and see reviews that other users have posted and maintain a list of games to play. Once youâ€™ve played a game, you can mark it as "played" and optionally leave a review for others to read. On the main screen, you can see a stream of the most recently-posted reviews across the entire website.
