I didn't make any spectacular visual changes, but I did try to make the templates at least not super ugly and I added some additional UX pointers here and there (redirects to appropriate pages after certain actions, flashed messages indicating to the user what to do on the page they've landed on after performing an action like changing a username or registering, etc.). I also added some additional links between pages to make it easier to navigate the site without having to use the back/forward buttons too often.
